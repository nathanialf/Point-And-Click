#Point and Click Adventure Game

I am making 2.5D Point and Click adventure game in unity. I am learning how to develop in unity in the process. Currently you can walk around and click objects to have some text display.

TODO:
Change the Node class for props so that every object can have their own way of interacting with other objects.
